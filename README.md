## Reflection

This was a 2 months long project built during my fifth semester of computer science engineering. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

This system has a main feature to digitalize the handwritten forms like student registration, exam 
registration etc. with minimal human work. The web application integrated these features with the 
college system where student counsellors can store digitized copy of the forms received from the 
students in a global database and also this can be used by administration department to digitalize 
plenty of handwritten forms, they receive every day. Also, students can be benefitted by the 
platform for receiving posts and notifications regarding notes, lecture videos, links, results, 
internship/placement offers, open consultancy projects etc.
